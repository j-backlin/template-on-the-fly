# template-on-the-fly
An Qlik Sense (server only) extension that allows users to duplicate prepared templates into their own 'My Work' area.

<h2>What?</h2>
It is merely an extension that enables you to easily create a good overview of apps that you want to allow others to create their own versions of. The main area of use would be if you often start your app development with a few things that most apps have in common, for example include scripts, master items, an introduction sheet etc.

<h2>Why?</h2>
This can be easily achieved with duplicating apps through for example the QMC. The extension is just to easily pick a few apps, give a little bit of a context around them and then easily allow those with access the ability to get their own copy of the app.

<h2>How?</h2>
  1. Add it to an application.
  2. Pick an app in the properties panel.
  3. Publish.
  4. Now other users can duplicate the app shown in the extension to their own 'My Work' area. This of course requires that the users are allowed to create new apps.
